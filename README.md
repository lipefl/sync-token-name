# Sync Token Names
 Simple Foundry VTT module to syncronize actor names with token names.
 
This is a fork of an original by lipefl

## Usage
Enable the module and it'll automatically update the token name everytime you change an actor's name. If you want, you can change the name of the token after this.
If you want to disable the sync, just disable the module.
